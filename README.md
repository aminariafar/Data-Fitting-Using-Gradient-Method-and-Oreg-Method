# ðŸ“ˆ Data Fitting Using Gradient Descent & Orthogonal Regression

This project explores **two mathematical approaches to data fitting** â€” the **Gradient Descent method** and the **Orthogonal Regression method** â€” applied to both synthetic and real-world datasets.

## âœ¨ Project Highlights
- **Notebook**: `gradient_oreg.ipynb`  
  - Implements **Gradient Descent** for iterative regression.  
  - Demonstrates **Orthogonal Regression** for accurate line fitting when both variables have errors.  
  - Structured into multiple parts:
  - # Data fitting using "Gradient Descent" method and "Orthogonal Regression" method
  - # Part 1: Gradient Descent method
  - ### 1.1
  - ### 1.2
  - #### Procedure for Data1
  - #### Procedure for Data2
  - #### Procedure for Data3
  - #### Procedure for Data4
  - ### 1.3
  - #### Procedure for Data3

- **Datasets** (`data/` folder):  
  - `data1.txt` â€¦ `data6.txt` â†’ Synthetic paired (x, y) datasets for regression testing.  
  - `Data3.txt` â€¦ `Data6.txt` â†’ Additional sets used in orthogonal regression.  
  - `boston.csv` â†’ Classic **Boston Housing dataset** used for regression and dimensionality analysis.

## ðŸŽ¯ Research Context
This project was prepared as part of a **university study on numerical optimization and regression techniques**.  
It illustrates how iterative optimization (gradient descent) compares with analytical methods (orthogonal regression) across multiple datasets.
